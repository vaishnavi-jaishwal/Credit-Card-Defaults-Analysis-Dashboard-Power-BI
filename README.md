**Project Name: Credit Card Default Analysis with Power BI Desktop**

**Description:**
This project is dedicated to analyzing credit card default data using Power BI Desktop, a powerful data visualization tool. By leveraging the capabilities of Power BI Desktop, we aim to gain insights into credit card default trends, identify potential risk factors, and optimize decision-making processes for financial institutions.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of credit card default data to facilitate informed decision-making. Specifically, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

1. Import and Transform Data: Utilize Power BI Desktop to import raw credit card default data and transform it into a structured format suitable for analysis.
2. Visualize Data and Create Reports: Create interactive visualizations and insightful reports using Power BI Desktop to present key findings and trends related to credit card defaults.
3. Analyze Default Trends: Explore patterns and trends in credit card default data to identify factors contributing to default rates and understand their implications.
4. Optimize Decision-Making: Utilize the insights gained from the analysis to optimize decision-making processes related to credit risk assessment and management.

**Project Structure:**
The project is structured into the following main components:

1. **Data Import and Transformation:** In this phase, we import raw credit card default data into Power BI Desktop and perform necessary data transformation tasks to prepare it for analysis.
2. **Data Visualization and Reporting:** We create interactive visualizations and insightful reports using Power BI Desktop to effectively communicate key findings and trends related to credit card defaults.
3. **Analysis and Insights:** This phase involves in-depth analysis of credit card default data to identify patterns, trends, and potential risk factors contributing to default rates.
4. **Decision-Making Optimization:** Based on the insights gained from the analysis, we aim to optimize decision-making processes related to credit risk assessment and management for financial institutions.
